## Slack Channels

### #ascent-daily

**Purpose:** Morning dashboard + real-time health status. The channel you check first thing.

**Automated posts:**
- **Morning briefing (09:15):** Recovery triad (HRV, sleep score, training readiness) with color indicators, Body Battery, resting HR, yesterday's activity summary. Ends with today's recommendation (train hard / moderate / rest).
- **Alerts** (as they fire): HRV drop >15%, sleep score <60, weight shift >1kg/3d, no activity 3+ days.

**Interactive — you can chat here:**
- "Shoulder feels off today" → Jarvis adjusts today's plan
- "I'm sore from yesterday" → Jarvis factors into readiness assessment
- "Feeling great, can I push harder?" → Jarvis gives the green light (or not) based on data
- Any subjective input about how you feel right now

**Tone:** Concise, status-oriented. Morning briefing is 5-8 lines max.

### #ascent-training

**Purpose:** The coach's notebook. Session plans, workout feedback, progression tracking, weekly analysis.

**Automated posts:**
- **Weekly analysis (Sunday 20:00):** Training volume (gym + mountain), HRV trend, sleep quality trend, activity distribution, progression notes, plan compliance.
- **Pre-session plan** (when workout generator is live): Today's workout with exercises, sets, reps, target weights.
- **Post-session feedback** (when Garmin push is live): How the session went vs plan, volume comparison, notable PRs.

**Interactive — you can chat here:**
- "Can we add more core work to Fridays?" → plan adjustment
- "I'll be traveling next week, no gym" → Jarvis restructures the week
- "Replace overhead press, shoulder bothers me" → exercise swap
- Any plan modifications or training questions

**Tone:** More detailed. Numbers, progressions, analysis. Threads for multi-turn discussions.

### Telegram (unchanged)

**Purpose:** Quick ad-hoc queries on the go.
- "How was my sleep?" → quick answer
- "What's my HRV trend?" → data lookup
- Not for structured coaching — that's Slack

-----

## Webapp (React on Vercel) — Phase 4b

**Purpose:** Your daily driver dashboard. The visual equivalent of what the YNAB dashboard is for finances.

**Tech:** React + Vite + Tailwind, deployed on Vercel. Reads from Supabase directly (REST API, anon key).

## Grafana Cloud — Alert Engine

Grafana's primary role is **alert evaluation**, not daily viewing. The webapp replaces Grafana as the visual interface.

### Alert 1: HRV Drop >15% from Baseline

```
Condition: last_night_avg < (baseline_balanced_low * 0.85)
Evaluation: Daily at 09:10 (after sync)
→ Webhook → OpenClaw → #ascent-daily
Message: "HRV Alert: Last night {value} is significantly below your baseline ({baseline}). Consider lighter intensity today."
Cooldown: 24h
```

### Alert 2: Sleep Score <60

```
Condition: overall_score < 60
Evaluation: Daily at 09:10
→ #ascent-daily
Message: "Sleep was rough ({value}/100). Recovery may be impaired — adjust today's plan if needed."
Cooldown: 24h
```

### Alert 3: No Activity for 3+ Days

```
Condition: No rows in activities for last 3 days
Evaluation: Daily at 09:10
→ #ascent-training
Message: "No recorded activity for 3 days. Is this planned rest or should we adjust the week?"
Cooldown: 72h
```

### Alert 4: Weight Shift >1kg in 3 Days

```
Condition: ABS(today - 3_days_ago) > 1.0 kg
Evaluation: Daily at 09:10
→ #ascent-daily
Message: "Weight moved {direction} {delta}kg in 3 days ({current}kg). Check hydration and intake."
Cooldown: 48h
```

### Alert webhook routing

Grafana webhook → OpenClaw HTTP endpoint → Jarvis formats with coaching context → posts to appropriate Slack channel.

## Pending Decisions

- [ ] Webapp domain: ascent.jarvis.app? health.oliwer.dev? Or Vercel default?
- [ ] Grafana webhook URL — depends on OpenClaw endpoint config
- [ ] Whether to build Grafana dashboards as interim MVP while webapp is developed
- [ ] Auth for webapp (Supabase auth? Or just anon key since single user?)
